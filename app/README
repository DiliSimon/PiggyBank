1. There shouldn't be an undo mechanism for two reasons. First, incorrect inputs are already handled
by the confirmation page, so there is no necessity for undo. Second, undo button may be pushed accidently,
and will result in data lost if the user don't have backup.

2. Yes. Because if the user want to input some new amount of money, it will be cumbersome if he or she
needs to delete the last input manually.

3. Nothing should happens. The app should examine the integrity of the input before entering into the confirmation page.

4. I add a reset button, since if will be convenient if one can clear all the data after some big consumptions
in the real world. I also removed the big color segments in the confirmation page, since I want it to look cleaner.
